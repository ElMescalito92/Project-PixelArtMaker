PROJECT: PIXEL ART MAKER 
By Felix Harder

For Udacity - Intro to Programming Nanodegree Program

PROJECT OVERVIEW

What Will I Build?
You’ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:

1. Dynamically set the size of the table as an _N_ by _M_ grid.
2. Choose a color.
1. Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

WHAT SKILLS DO I NEED?

In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills including:

- Defining variables with const and let
- Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
- Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
- Writing nested loops and using loop variables
